### Broccoli Weekly Subscription
**$15.00/8oz**

**Product Details**  
Broccoli microgreens are full of nutrients. Compared to adult broccoli plants, they contain 10 to 100x more sulforaphane--a compound thought to fight cancer. Because sulforaphane also combats inflammation, it has powerful rejuvenating properties, supports cardiovascular health, and reduces oxidative stress.

They are delicious and taste great in sandwiches, wraps, smoothies, or salads. Chefs often use them to garnish soups and salads and are a fun way for kids to get their broccoli.

**Description**  
The healthiest microgreens on the block! These little guys pack a serious punch when it comes to improving your health. Broccoli microgreens contain a naturally occurring compound known as Sulforaphane. Research has suggested that sulforaphane has cancer preventative properties, is a powerful antioxidant, and aids in reducing inflammation.
