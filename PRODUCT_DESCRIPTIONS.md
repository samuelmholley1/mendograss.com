### Pea Shoots Weekly Subscription
**$10.00/8oz**

**Product Details**  
Pea shoots are a great source of beta carotene, vitamin C, folate, and fiber. In fact, a single serving of pea shoots provides 50% of your daily vitamin C value. They also have anti-inflammatory properties thanks to their flavonoid and polyphenol content and are thought to be anti-carcinogenic.

Pea shoots are delicious saut√©ed, in a raw salad or smoothie, or even alone.

**Description**  
Our sweet pea microgreens are oh so sweet and tender! Sweet pea microgreens are low in fat and packed with high-quality protein and powerful antioxidants. They contain protein, fiber, omega-3, and are rich in folate, carbohydrates, vitamins A, B, C, and E.

### Broccoli Weekly Subscription
**$15.00/8oz**

**Product Details**  
Broccoli microgreens are full of nutrients. Compared to adult broccoli plants, they contain 10 to 100x more sulforaphane--a compound thought to fight cancer. Because sulforaphane also combats inflammation, it has powerful rejuvenating properties, supports cardiovascular health, and reduces oxidative stress.

They are delicious and taste great in sandwiches, wraps, smoothies, or salads. Chefs often use them to garnish soups and salads and are a fun way for kids to get their broccoli.

### Radish Weekly Subscription
**$15.00/8oz**

**Product Details**  
Need a quick cleanse? A dose of radish micros sets you on the right path. Radish micros help your liver function more efficiently and are highest in vitamin E compared to adult radishes and other microgreens. They also contain lignans, enhancing the activity of macrophages (cells that attack our bodies' foreign invaders).

Spicy like wasabi and horseradish, this fiery microgreen pairs well with fish and meat dishes.
