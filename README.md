    *   "Empowering health through sustainable superfoods” is the section heading [8].
    *   **Tagline**: "Grass Rooted in Ukiah, California" – a playful phrase introducing their story [9].
    *   **Story**: The text welcomes visitors and explains the farm's origin and values. For example: "Welcome to Mendo Grass, where we are on a mission to provide sustainable and organic superfoods to our community. Founded by Adam, Amanda, and our daughter, Arden, our family's journey began at the Solar Living Institute, where we discovered the incredible healing powers of wheatgrass. Inspired by its impact on a friend's health, we set out to create a farm dedicated to growing wheatgrass and microgreens." [10] This is followed by details of their present operations and commitment: "Today, Mendo Grass thrives in the scenic valleys of southern Mendocino County, surrounded by oak woodlands and organic vineyards. Our commitment to sustainability is unwavering. We utilize renewable energy, harness the sun, and nourish our crops with rainwater. We exclusively use organic seeds and soil, ensuring the highest quality produce." [11] Finally, they express their goal and invite the community: “With love for the land and the food we grow, we provide fresh, nutrient-rich wheatgrass and microgreens to Mendocino and Sonoma counties. Our goal is simple: to bring immunity-boosting foods to your table and add a touch of sunshine to your life. Find us at your favorite local farmers market, or shop online to join us on this sustainable journey towards a healthier, happier future—one microgreen at a time." [12].

## Proposed Tech Stack and Feasibility Analysis

The proposed tech stack is a **Next.js** application (React framework) with **Tailwind CSS** for styling, deployed on **Vercel**.

*   **Next.js & React**: An excellent framework for this project, supporting both static site generation and server-side rendering. This allows for fast, SEO-friendly pre-rendered pages with the flexibility to add dynamic features later. In 2025, Next.js (using the App Router) is a leading solution for scalable web apps [42, 43, 44]. It's maintained by Vercel, ensuring first-class deployment support [45].
*   **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS approach that makes it efficient to implement designs consistently. It integrates well with Next.js and speeds up styling with ready-to-use utility classes for layout, typography, and responsive design [44, 46].
*   **Deployment on Vercel**: The natural choice for hosting a Next.js project. It offers zero-configuration deployment, a global CDN, serverless functions, and easy integration with GitHub for continuous deployment [45].
*   **GitHub Copilot (Pro) for Development**: Using an advanced model like Claude Sonnet 4 integrated into GitHub Copilot is a very effective approach. It can significantly speed up development by generating boilerplate and complex components from natural language prompts, excelling at multi-file code generation tasks [47, 48].

### Red-Team Analysis / Alternatives

There are no obvious red flags. While a simpler static site generator could work, Next.js provides full control and future expandability [42]. Alternatives like Gatsby or plain React exist, but Next.js offers easier page-based routing and deployment. The proposed Next.js + React + Tailwind stack, deployed on Vercel, is well-suited and likely the **best way** to faithfully recreate the Mendo Grass site.

## Prompting Strategy for GitHub Copilot (Claude Sonnet 4)

Below is a series of prompts to build the site step-by-step.

### 1. Prompt 1 - Initialize Project and Install Tailwind
  Create a new Next.js project (using the App Router) with Tailwind CSS. Include a components directory for shared components. Set up Tailwind by adding the necessary config in tailwind.config.js (with ./app/**/* and ./components/**/* in content) and a global stylesheet importing Tailwind in app/globals.css. Ensure the project builds and Tailwind classes apply.```2. Prompt 2 - Create the Navigation Bar Component code Codedownloadcontent_copyexpand_lessIGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_STARTIGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END    In our Next.js app, create a new React component `components/Navbar.tsx` using Tailwind CSS for styling. This Navbar should include:

1.  The Mendo Grass logo on the left (use an `<Image>` from `next/image` with `src="/images/logo.png"` as a placeholder, alt="Mendo Grass logo").
2.  A navigation menu on the right with these links: **About, Find Us, Contact, Subscriptions, Newsletter, Wholesale**.
    *   Set **About, Find Us, Contact** to link to section anchors on the home page (e.g., `href="#about"`).
    *   Set **Subscriptions** to link to the `/subscriptions` page using Next's `<Link>`.
    *   Set **Newsletter** and **Wholesale** to external URL `https://www.gofarmhand.com` (as placeholders), opening in a new tab.
3.  Make the Navbar responsive: On large screens, links are horizontal. On mobile, hide the links and show a hamburger menu icon. Use `useState` to toggle a vertical dropdown menu.
4.  Style the nav bar with a white background, dark/green text, and make it fixed to the top (sticky).
5.  Ensure the mobile menu closes when a link is clicked.
Return the JSX for this Navbar component.
  3. Prompt 3 - Create the Footer Component code Codedownloadcontent_copyexpand_lessIGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_STARTIGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END    Now create a React component `components/Footer.tsx` using Tailwind. The Footer should contain the following content:

1.  A **Contact Us** section with:
    *   Address: 1321 Sirah Ct. Ukiah, CA 95482
    *   Email: `micros@mendograss.com` (as a `mailto:` link)
    *   Phone: `(707) 391-9659` (as a `tel:` link)
    *   Icon links for Facebook and Instagram (placeholders).
2.  A **Markets** section listing:
    *   Saturdays - Healdsburg Farmers Market, Santa Rosa Farmers Market, Ukiah Farmers Market
    *   Sundays - Sebastopol Farmers Market
3.  A **Stores & Restaurants** section listing:
    *   Grocers: Ukiah Natural Foods Co-op, Mariposa Market
    *   Restaurants: Asahi Sushi & Kitchen, Black Oak Coffee Roasters, Mama's Cafe, Pizzando, Troubadour
4.  At the bottom, a small copyright line: "© 2025 Mendo Grass. All rights reserved." and "Powered by Farmhand".
5.  Style the footer with a dark background and white text. The layout should be multi-column on desktop and stack vertically on mobile.
Return the JSX for the Footer.
  4. Prompt 4 - Layout and Home Page code Codedownloadcontent_copyexpand_lessIGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_STARTIGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END    Set up the Next.js App Router layout and the Home page:

1.  Create `app/layout.tsx`: This should import Tailwind's `globals.css`. In the `<body>`, include the `<Navbar />` at the top and `<Footer />` at the bottom, with `{children}` in between. Include a basic `<html>` structure with `<title>Mendo Grass</title>`.

2.  Create the Home page at `app/page.tsx`. This page should include the following sections in order, using text from the Mendo Grass website:
    *   A **hero section** with a background image (`/images/hero.jpg`), the `h1` tagline "Growing organic green goodness under the California sun", and a "Shop" button linking to `/subscriptions`.
    *   A section for the **"9x the nutrients"** highlight.
    *   A **"Sun-grown-to-order microgreens & wheatgrass"** subheading section.
    *   A 3-column grid for **Product categories** (Microgreens, Wheatgrass, PeaSto), each with a placeholder image and its description.
    *   A full-width **"Certified organic, from seed to soil"** banner.
    *   The **About Us section** (`id="about"`) with its heading, subheading, and full story text. Optionally use a two-column layout with a placeholder image.
    *   A **Newsletter Sign-up** section (`id="newsletter"`) with the call-out text and a form containing an email input and a "Subscribe" button. Include hidden `<p>` tags for the "Thank you!" and "Oops!" messages.

Rely on the Footer component to display the Contact, Find Us, and Markets information. Use semantic HTML and Tailwind CSS for styling. Return the code for `app/layout.tsx` and `app/page.tsx`.
  5. Prompt 5 - Subscriptions Page code Codedownloadcontent_copyexpand_lessIGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_STARTIGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END    Now create the Subscriptions page at `app/subscriptions/page.tsx`. This page will use the shared Navbar and Footer automatically. Define the page content to include:

1.  An `h1` heading: "Subscribe to access weekly, grown-to-order microgreens & wheatgrass".
2.  A prominent "Select Subscription" button linking to `https://www.gofarmhand.com`.
3.  A **"How It Works"** section with three steps ("Select a size", "Subscribe", "Skip when needed") using the exact description text for each.
4.  A **Pickup & Delivery** section with its descriptive paragraph and the market pickup schedule.
5.  A **Subscriptions Plans** section (`id="subscriptions"`) in a 3-column grid. Each of the three plans (Microgreens 5oz, Microgreens 8oz, Wheatgrass Live Tray) should be a card containing:
    *   A placeholder image.
    *   The subscription title, name, price, and full description.
    *   A "Subscribe" button linking to an external site.
6.  A **Weekly Add-ons** section with its title and descriptive text.
7.  A final call-to-action banner with the text "Get your greens" and one more "Select Subscription" button.

Use Tailwind CSS to style this page consistent with the home page. Return the code for `app/subscriptions/page.tsx`.
